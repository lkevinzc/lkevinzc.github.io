I am a research engineer at Sea AI Lab (SAIL). Prior to that I worked as a algorithm engineer at Shopee. I enjoy playing badminton and other sports.

During my bachelor time back to NUS, I played table tennis in the Sheares Hall team, jointly organized several events under Chinese Society, and enjoyed playing with FPGAs, circuit boards, antennas and coding. In my last year, I have been fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jshfeng/" target="_blank">Dr. Jiashi Feng</a> for my final year project (thesis) on instance segmentation.

Keep learning, keep trying good and interesting things and stay curious. That is how I plan to do on the way to happiness and goodness.
