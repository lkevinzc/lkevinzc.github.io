I am an algorithm engineer focusing on computer vision in Shopee. In my work I apply algorithms and models to solve real-world problems. I am interested in optimizing model inference deployment and related engineering topics. After work I enjoy playing badminton.

During my bachelor time back to NUS, I played table tennis in the Sheares Hall team, jointly organized several events under Chinese Society, and enjoyed playing with circuit boards, FPGAs, C, assembly, Fourier transforms, EM waves, Python etc. In my last year, I have been fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jshfeng/" target="_blank">Dr. Jiashi Feng</a> for my final year project (thesis) on instance segmentation.

Keep learning, keep trying good and interesting things and stay curious. That is how I plan to do on the way to happiness and goodness.
