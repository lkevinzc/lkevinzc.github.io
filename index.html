I am a final year undergraduate studying in National University of Singapore (NUS). Academia-wise I am interested in machine learning, computer vision and their applications. Other than that I enjoy playing sports like table tennis and many others (not often though). 

</br></br>
Currently I am doing my final year project with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jshfeng/" target="_blank">Dr. Jiashi Feng</a>, who is a very great mentor as well as friend. I'm also a part-time data science intern at Shopee Singapore. I really like the <a href="assets/pdf/Shopee_office.pdf" target="_blank">Shopee office</a> and the job I'm working on.

Inspired by many friends, met or not, I decided to share some of the things I learnt or some random photos and random thoughts here. I hope to keep trying good and interesting things and stay curious. As I told myself, I am on my way to happiness and goodness.
