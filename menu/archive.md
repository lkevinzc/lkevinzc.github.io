- <a href="../assets/pdf/EE4218Demo.pdf" target="_blank"> Embedded Hardware System Design Demonstration </a> 

    This is a demo slide for the final project of the module [EE4218](https://nusmods.com/modules/EE4218/embedded-hardware-system-design){:target="_blank"} (Autumn, 2019), taught by [Dr. Rajesh](https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/raje/){:target="_blank"} in NUS. It includes nearly all the processes in an FPGA design, from sequential logic optimization, behavioral synthesis, architectural synthesis to scheduling and binding, technology mapping, physical synthesis. The project is to implement a neural network on the system-on-chip, and utilize FPGA to accelerate the inference stage.


- [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7jV_T61yg){:target="_blank"} (or [this on bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av56362371){:target="_blank"}) for a scene text extraction model developed during my internship at Shopee

    The model shown in the demo is based on [Connectionist Text Proposal Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03605.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05717.pdf){:target="_blank"}. There are still many problems with this model, such as not good at detecting oriented text (vertical anchor nature), expensive computation (repeated convolution and heavy VGG) and two separate stages for detection and recognition (unified network will perform better, by experiment in [Liu's work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.01671.pdf){:target="_blank"}). I will try to develop a better model ;D

- <a href="../assets/pdf/EE5907HelpSheet.pdf" target="_blank"> Pattern Recognition Help Sheet </a> 

    This is a help sheet for the module [EE5907](https://nusmods.com/modules/EE5907/pattern-recognition){:target="_blank"} (Spring, 2019), taught by [Dr. Thomas](https://sites.google.com/view/yeolab/thomas){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Jiashi](https://sites.google.com/site/jshfeng/){:target="_blank"} in NUS. It includes some topics in pattern recognition ranging from Naive Bayes Classifier to Convolutional Neural Networks. The module gives me an overview of the field and this help sheet was prepared for the final exam ;D


- <a href="../assets/pdf/EE4212HelpSheet.pdf" target="_blank"> Computer Vision Help Sheet </a> 

    This is a help sheet for the module [EE4212](https://nusmods.com/modules/EE4212/computer-vision){:target="_blank"} (Spring, 2019), taught by <a href="https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/eleclf/" target="_blank"> Dr. Cheong </a> and [Dr. Jiashi](https://sites.google.com/site/jshfeng/){:target="_blank"} in NUS. It includes both mid-level vision, such as stereo analysis and structure from motion, and techniques for processing images like segmentation, HDR and panorama, etc. This module is not much related to deep learning approaches, instead, it outlines some traditional vision challenges and methods. This help sheet was prepared for the final exam as a brief summary ;D
